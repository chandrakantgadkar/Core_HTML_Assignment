    <h2>Choosing a Web Design Tool</h2>
    <p>There are two main ways to design a website:  using a desktop app or using a website builder. The  tool you decide to use will vary greatly based  on your team size, your budget, and the type of site you wish to build and its technical requirements. </p>
    <h2>1. Desktop Apps </h2>
    <p>Desktop apps require designers to create their design and send it to a development team who can then convert the design to code. The most popular desktop apps for designing websites are Photoshop and Sketch. </p>
    <h2>2. Website Builders</h2>
    <p>There are many website builders on the market today that offer a wide range of features and services. Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, and Pagecloud, are just a few examples of popular website builders that vary in design capabilities, template options, price, and overall editing experience. Be sure to do your research, experiment with free trials, and determine which platform best fits your website needs. </p>
